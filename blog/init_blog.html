                    It's currently 3 A.M. and I honestly don't know what to put here. I regularly don't talk
                    about myself, unless it was in my previous therapy sessions years ago when I was in Job Corps.
                    I'm currently working on a few projects right now, this Neocities site being one of them. I'm
                    also currently looking for a job hence the name "NEETDemon" (NEET in all caps when you spell
                    the man name). Hopefully I can find something good, and preferably something remote because I
                    don't have a car. I'm a little worried because I'm staying with a childhood friend and his
                    family right now, but my time here in this house along with theirs is limited. They are really
                    amazing people for helping me out when I am down on my luck, even when theirs isn't the best
                    right now either, and I'm so thankful to have them in my life. I don't mean to sound depressed
                    in my first blog post so I'm just going to get on with it.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    While I try to find a job I'm trying to do more things to express myself during the down times
                    of waiting. I guess for starter's since you're already here, here's a few things I'm *thinking*
                    of doing to this website:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    -- Dynamically creating blog and *possibly* other web pages using (unfortunately) more client side
                    JavaScript, and fetching the data from my GitHub in the form of a markdown and parsing it to HTML.
                    This is also a good way to get around the Neocities 1GB filehost limit, also so I don't go insane
                    from constantly coding these blog posts in HTML.
                    <br />
                    -- Obviously finish the rest of this website.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    ... Yup, that's all I could think of right now. I swear I had more ideas before I even typed this
                    section,
                    but I'm just so dead tired right now (it's currently 4:20AM as I'm typing this AYYYYYYYYYY). I guess
                    one thing
                    I'm willing to share that I'm currently working on is a YouTube channel. So keep your eye out for
                    that!
                    I normally don't like to talk about what it is I'm thinking of doing because if I share these ideas
                    with
                    people and I don't commit to them, then I just feel hella guilty. But I mean this is my blog so I
                    just
                    want to share whatever goes on in my brain. Anyways I'm gonna end it here before I start rambling
                    more,
                    and if you made it this far in the blog post, all I could say is... *why*? But also thanks for
                    reading!
